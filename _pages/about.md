🧑🏻‍💻 I am Zhanming /zɑːn miŋ/, a PhD student in the Human Factor and Ergonomics (HFE) program at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I completed my Master’s degree in interaction design and Bachelor's degree in marketing at Sun Yat-sen University (China) in 2023 and 2019, respectively.

⚖️ I was born in Guangzhou and lived in this city with its fascinating fusion features for 26 years. Immersed in this city’s diverse culture, ethnicity, food, and language, I have been interested in diversity and equity in society since a young age. I have actively participated in public service activities such as education in low socio-economic communities and services for the senior community.

🏥 My experiences inspire my interests in human-computer interaction (HCI) and collaborative and social computing, focusing on alleviating inequity in healthcare contexts. My goal is to apply participatory design approaches to support the unique requirements of people in underserved communities and reduce the “JAM” moments in their daily routines. I am currently working with the Asian-American community in Minnesota and designing supportive technology-mediated solutions.

📺 Before starting graduate studies, I interned at Tencent (game) as a game designer and then at NetEase (game) and Jinfangka (consultancy) as digital marketing specialists. These are followed by a full-time position as a marketing specialist at Times China (real estate). With exciting teamwork and experiences in diverse sectors, I polished my skills in game design, graphic design, consumer behavior research, customer relationship management (CRM), and integrated marketing.
