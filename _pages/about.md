🧑🏻‍💻 I am Zhanming /zɑːn miŋ/, a PhD student in the Human Factor and Ergonomics (HFE) program at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I obtained my Master’s degree in interaction design and Bachelor in marketing at Sun Yat-sen University (China) in 2023 and 2019, separately.

🏥 My research interests include human-computer interaction (HCI) and collaborative and social computing, with focuses on alleviating inequity in healthcare contexts. My goal is to apply asset-based design approaches to support the unique requirements of people in underserved communities and reduce the “JAM” moments in their daily routines. I am currently working with the Asian-American community in Minnesota and designing technology-mediated solutions for them.

📺 Before starting graduate studies, I interned at Tencent (game) as a game designer, and then NetEase (game) and Jinfangka (consultancy) as digital marketing specialists. These are followed by a full-time position as a marketing specialist at Times China (real estate). With exciting teamwork and productive performance, I enhanced my skills in game design, graphic design, consumer behavior research, customer relationship management (CRM), and integrated marketing.

\[04-12-2024\] Thanks to Sarah Paynter for citing our study _"User-Defined Foot Gestures for Eyes-Free Interaction in Smart Shower Rooms"_ in her latest article in the Wall Street Journal! Using the participatory design approach, we distilled a set of five foot gestures for six concurrent tasks (e.g., controlling water volume while washing hair) to support hands-free experiences in smart shower rooms. We further proposed a taxonomy and design guidelines for foot gesture design in this study.
