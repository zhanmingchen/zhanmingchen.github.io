🧑🏻‍💻 I am Zhanming /zɑːn miŋ/, a PhD student in the Human Factor and Ergonomics (HFE) program at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I obtained my Master’s degree in interaction design and Bachelor in marketing at Sun Yat-sen University (China) in 2023 and 2019, separately.

🏥 My research interests include human-computer interaction (HCI) and collaborative and social computing, with focuses on alleviating inequity in healthcare contexts. My goal is to apply asset-based design approaches to support the unique requirements of people in underserved communities and reduce the “JAM” moments in their daily routines. I am currently working with the Asian-American community in Minnesota and designing technology-mediated solutions for them.

📺 Before starting graduate studies, I interned at Tencent and NetEase as a game designer and digital marketing specialist, respectively. These are followed by a full-time position as a marketing specialist at Time China (a real estate company in China). I enhanced my skills in game design, consumer behavior research, customer relationship management (CRM), and digital marketing.
