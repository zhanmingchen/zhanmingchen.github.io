🧑🏻‍💻 I am a PhD student in the Human Factor and Ergonomics (HFE) program at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I obtained my Master’s degree in interaction design and a Bachelor’s degree in marketing at Sun Yat-sen University in 2023 and 2019, separately.

🏥 My research interests include human-computer interaction (HCI) and collaborative and social computing. I especially focus on design inequity and healthcare contexts. My goal is to apply asset-based design methods to support the unique requirements of people in underserved communities and reduce the “JAM” moments in their daily routines. I am currently working with the Asian-American community in Minnesota and designing technology-mediated supports for them.

🕹 Before I entered graduate schools, I had internships at Tencent and NetEase (game companies in China), and further got a full-time position as a marketing analyst at Time China (a real estate company in China). I enhanced my skills in game design, customer relationship management (CRM) system operation, marketing campaign planning, and integrated marketing.
