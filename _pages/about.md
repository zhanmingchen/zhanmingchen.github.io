🧑🏻‍💻 I am Zhanming /zɑːn miŋ/, a PhD student in the Human Factor and Ergonomics (HFE) program at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I completed my Master’s degree in interaction design and Bachelor's degree in marketing at Sun Yat-sen University (China) in 2023 and 2019, respectively.

⚖️ I was born and raised in Guangzhou and have lived in this city with its fascinating fusion features for 26 years. Immersed in this city’s diverse culture, language, architecture, and delicacies, I have been interested in diversity and equity in society since I was young. I have actively participated in public service activities such as voluntary teaching in low socio-economic communities and services for the senior community.

🏥 My experiences inspire my interests in human-computer interaction (HCI) and collaborative and social computing, focusing on alleviating inequity in healthcare contexts. My goal is to apply asset-based design approaches to support the unique requirements of people in underserved communities and reduce the “JAM” moments in their daily routines. I am currently working with the Asian-American community in Minnesota and designing technology-mediated solutions for them.

📺 Before starting graduate studies, I interned at Tencent (game) as a game designer and then at NetEase (game) and Jinfangka (consultancy) as digital marketing specialists. These are followed by a full-time position as a marketing specialist at Times China (real estate). With exciting teamwork and experiences in diverse sectors, I polished my skills in game design, graphic design, consumer behavior research, customer relationship management (CRM), and integrated marketing.

 <span class="highlight" style="background-color: #ffd40070">[04-12-2024]</span> Thanks to Sarah Paynter for citing our study _"User-Defined Foot Gestures for Eyes-Free Interaction in Smart Shower Rooms"_ in her latest article in the _Wall Street Journal_! Using the participatory design approach, we distilled a set of five foot gestures for six concurrent tasks (e.g., controlling water volume while washing hair) to support hands-free experiences in smart shower rooms. We further proposed a taxonomy and design guidelines for foot gesture design in this study.
