## Highlights

During Spring 2023, I worked as a teaching assistant supervised by Dr. Huiyue Wu. For the undergraduate course "Digital Media Frontiers", I created slides for one of the classes and graded assignments for 91 students. I also recorded and edited videos during one class for the purpose of open online courses.
