## Requirement Analysis

The number of college graduates in China is increasing in recent years, so is the pressure in job hunting. I therefore designed a high-fidelity prototype of a mobile application named “BibTalk”, an online tool for college graduates during job hunting, based on the results from market analysis, competitive analysis, and data from a semi-structured interview with potential end-users.

I created the UX map, information structure, mood board before the UI design process through methods such as brainstorm, persona, and scenario to summarize users’ requirements.

## Visual Design

The interface of BibTalk has been carefully designed to cater to the mental model of graduates, in terms of colors, fonts and icons. BibTalk is created to help graduates improve efficiency during job hunting and help them find dream jobs.
