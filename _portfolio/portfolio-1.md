## Project Description

This project, led by the School of Communication and Design, Sun Yat-sen University, was specially developed for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. In this project, users are able to experience the Beijing Winter Olympic games (e.g., freestyle skiing) in an immersive VR environment using natural human-computer interaction techniques, such as virtual navigation, virtual object manipulation and system control.

As a team member of the project, I was in charge of project presentation, including producing the showcase video and reaching out to the media press.
