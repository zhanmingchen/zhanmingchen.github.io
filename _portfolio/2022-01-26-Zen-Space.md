## Project Description

</p>

Zen Space is an in-home mindfulness-based stress reduction AR application developed with Unity3D and C# language. In a preliminary experiment, I found that Zen Space significantly lowered usersâ€™ level of anxiety and improved their level of mindfulness through multi-model input (hand gestures, verbalization, and eye movements) and multi-sense feedback (vision and audio).

### 1. Auditory Meditation Guidance

In these scenes, users practice respired mindfulness sessions (1) under the guidance of the virtual mentor, or (2) following the therapeutic music and visualized feedback.

</p>

### 2. Gesture-based Meditation and Slow Interaction

In these scenes, users are encouraged to interact with hand gestures to: (1) draw patterns, or (2) pinch to generate lotus flowers. Such slow interaction releases the users from the sources of their anxiety and helps them regain the control of mind.

### 3. Eye Movement Recognition and Interaction

In this scene, users are encouraged to focus on the butterfly and receive feedback on falling petals. This session helps users boost concentration.

## Pilot User Test

We recruited 10 partipants from the university for a pilot user test. We asked the participants to fill in a pre-test survey questionnaire, walk through the whole mindfulness training session, and then fill in a post-test survey questionnaire. Each experiments sesson were conducted in a usability lab and lasted for about 40 minutes. Results show that "Zen Space" is effective in increasing participants' perceived level of mindfulness and decreasing the level of anxiety.
